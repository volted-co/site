<h3>Purchase Processing</h3>

Users must ensure their payment information is correct before proceeding with any transaction. We reserve the right to refuse any refund request at our discretion.</p>

<h3>Service Availability and Continuity</h3>
<p>We maintain the right to modify or discontinue software and services at our discretion. While local software functionality may continue, online features are subject to change. Previously purchased licenses remain valid in their existing form, and support and updates are provided at our discretion. We do not issue refunds for discontinued features or services. Changes to third-party integrations may affect functionality, and open source software continues to be available under its respective license terms.</p>

<h2>Subscription Terms</h2>
<p>Our subscription-based services operate on a recurring billing cycle according to your selected plan. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date. Any changes to subscription tiers take effect at the next billing cycle. We do not provide refunds for partial subscription periods. We may modify subscription features with 30 days notice, and price changes take effect at the next billing cycle. Subscriptions may be terminated for violations of these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Consultancy Services</h2>
<p>Our technology consultancy services are governed by separate consulting agreements that specify rates, payment terms, and deliverables. We maintain ownership of all pre-existing intellectual property unless explicitly stated otherwise in the consulting agreement. No employment relationship is created through these services, and all parties are bound by confidentiality obligations as detailed in the consulting agreement. We reserve the right to subcontract portions of consulting services as needed.</p>

<h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
<p>When contributing to our open source projects, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the respective project's license. You warrant that you have the right to grant such license, and you acknowledge that we may use, modify, and redistribute your contributions. You explicitly waive any claims related to our use of your contributions.</p>

<h2>Local AI Processing</h2>
<p>For services that include Local AI features, all processing is performed using your local computer resources. VOLTED does not provide or maintain any AI processing capabilities, and performance depends entirely on your hardware configuration. You are responsible for managing your computer's resources and ensuring system requirements are met.</p>

<p>When using unattended AI content generation, operations will run according to your configured schedule and settings. Processing occurs locally on your machine at specified intervals, with resource usage limited to what's necessary for advertised features. By using these features, you acknowledge and accept that your computer will be used for these tasks.</p>

<p>Our commitment to responsible AI usage means that local AI capabilities are used strictly for service operation and processing is limited to fulfilling advertised features. No additional or unrelated AI processing will be performed, and you maintain full control over AI feature activation and settings.</p>

<p>Regarding system requirements, you are responsible for ensuring your system meets the minimum specifications detailed in our service documentation. Performance may vary based on your hardware configuration, and no refunds will be issued for inability to run AI workloads locally.</p>

<p>For alternative processing options, our services support OpenAI API as an alternative to local AI processing (Ollama). If you choose not to use or cannot run local AI processing, you may opt to use your own OpenAI API key. The OpenAI API key must be procured directly from OpenAI, and all associated costs are your sole responsibility. We do not provide refunds related to OpenAI API costs as this is a user-selected alternative to local processing.</p>

<h2>Export Compliance</h2>
<p>The Services are subject to export laws and regulations. By using our Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to U.S. Government embargo or designated as a "terrorist supporting" country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

<h2>Force Majeure</h2>
<p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond that party's reasonable control, including acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemic, changes in laws or regulations, labor disputes, and failures of suppliers or subcontractors.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in English and shall take place in [Your Jurisdiction]. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>

<h2>Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
