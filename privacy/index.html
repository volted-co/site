<p>This privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect and use at VOLTED, and the choices you have associated with that information. When we refer to "VOLTED," "we," "our," or "us" in this policy, we are referring to the VOLTED website at https://volted.co (the "Site"), the VOLTED-developed software and its websites (the "Services") and the developers of these software (the "Developers").</p>

<p><strong>The Terms of Use were last modified on February 12, 2025.</strong></p>

<h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>

<p>We collect different types of information depending on the VOLTED offerings you use. This information falls into several categories:</p>

<h3>Identity and Access Data</h3>
<p>We collect basic account credentials including email addresses and passwords necessary for authentication. For service operation and security purposes, we gather device identifiers, IP addresses, and machine IDs. These identifiers help us maintain secure access to our services and protect against unauthorized use.</p>

<h3>Registration Data</h3>
<p>When applicable to the service you're using, we may collect personal identification information such as your name and contact details. For business users, we also collect relevant company information. This information helps us provide appropriate service levels and maintain accurate records of service usage. We also store your account preferences to customize your experience.</p>

<h3>Service Operation Data</h3>
<p>To maintain and improve our services, we collect technical data essential for functionality. This includes configuration settings you've specified, patterns of service usage, and performance metrics. We also gather error and crash reports to help us identify and resolve technical issues, ensuring stable operation of our services.</p>

<h3>Analytics and Improvement Data</h3>
<p>To enhance our services, we analyze usage patterns and feature interactions. This includes collecting anonymized statistics about how our services are used, tracking error patterns, and gathering performance data. This information helps us understand how our services are being used and guides our development efforts for improvements and new features.</p>

<h2>Payment Processing</h2>

<p>For purchases and transactions, all payments are processed by Stripe, our trusted payment provider. We do not implement or maintain any payment processing systems ourselves. When making a purchase, you will be redirected to Stripe's secure payment interface where you can safely enter your payment details.</p>

<p>All payment information you provide is handled directly by Stripe, and we only receive transaction confirmation after successful processing. This ensures your payment data remains secure and is handled by a trusted payment processor. For detailed information about how Stripe handles your payment data, you can refer to their privacy policy at https://stripe.com/privacy.</p>

<h2>Data Security and Privacy</h2>

<p>We implement comprehensive security measures to protect your data. This includes industry-standard encryption for all data transmission and secure storage systems with strict access controls to protect your information at rest.</p>

<p>Regarding privacy, we maintain several important commitments to our users. We do not sell personal data to third parties under any circumstances. Any data sharing is strictly limited to what is necessary for service operation. All personal data is processed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. You maintain control over your personal information, with options to access, update, or delete your data as described in this policy.</p>

<h2>Cookies and online tracking</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small file placed on your computer that stores information. Overall, cookies help us provide you with better services. We may use cookies to verify your browser and to maintain your session. These cookies don’t collect personally identifiable information. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site. If you opt out of using cookies, we may employ a cookie only to help us remember this preference. If you would like further information on the cookies we employ, please contact us.</p>

Some of the purposes for which we use your personal information are described in this Privacy Policy. Some of the uses of your information are necessary for the services we provide through VOLTED or for the reason you provided us with the information, and if you don’t want your information used in certain ways, it may prevent you from using VOLTED.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. We maintain or use third parties to maintain physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to safeguard the information we collect through the Site. However, no information can be absolutely secure, and we can’t guarantee the security of any information that is the subject of this Privacy Policy or any information that is submitted to us via the Internet.</p>

<p>When using third-party Login capabilities on VOLTED, access tokens from that third-party service might be needed. When you provide these tokens, these are stored in your device. VOLTED uses these tokens only to authenticate the requests with the third-party. We don’t transmit or store access tokens on our servers. You must take necessary safeguard measures to ensure your access tokens are secure.</p>

<h2>Update Your Information</h2>
<p>We will let you update your personal information that you have provided to us through the methods available on VOLTED. You may also contact us to update your information. We will also take steps to make sure that any updates that you provide are processed in a timely and complete manner.</p>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>Third parties may operate or host the Site or the computers that operate the Site, store or process data for us, and provide services related to the information requests that you have submitted or communications we provide to you. We do not sell personally identifiable information collected on VOLTED to third party marketers.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the country in which you are located. The personnel who use your information as part of the practices described in this Privacy Policy may also be located outside the United States, EEA or the country in which you are located. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.</p>

<p>We may process your information to correct technical problems and malfunctions in VOLTED, and to maintain the security and integrity of our services. This processing is essential for protecting both our rights and property as well as those of others using our services.</p>

<p>When necessary, we may process information to address claims regarding information rights violations or to comply with applicable laws and judicial processes. This includes responding to legal requirements and providing information to law enforcement agencies when required for matters of public safety.</p>

<p>Technical processing of your information may be required for several operational purposes. This includes enabling message transmission related to your use of VOLTED, ensuring compatibility with connecting networks, adapting to service limitations, and meeting other technical requirements necessary for service operation.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>We may periodically update this Privacy Policy. For example, we may update this policy in order to describe how new features may affect our use of your information and to let you know of new controls and features that we may provide you.
